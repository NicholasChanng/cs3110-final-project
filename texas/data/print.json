  "game_description": "\nBefore each round, players must place two mandatory bets: the Ante bet and \nthe Blind bet, which are equal in amount. The Ante bet is a wager that the \nplayer makes to participate in the game and is gained if the player wins, \nwhile the Blind bet is a separate bet that can lead to a payout if the \nplayer's final hand qualifies, given that the player wins. There is a \nthird, optional bet, the Trip, which works like the Blind with a different \npayout structure but does not require the player to win. The round begins \nwith the player receiving two cards. Community cards are dealt in two \nstages: three cards (flop), then two more cards (river). The player can bet \nin rounds, after which no further bet can be made; the river is dealt and \nthe outcome is determined by comparison with the dealerâ€™s hand. Otherwise, \nthe player may check. There are three phases of betting. During the first \nphase, before the flop, the player may place a Play bet of 4x or 3x the \nAnte. During the second phase, after the flop, the player may place a Play \nbet of 2x the Ante. During the final phase, after the river, the player may \nplace a Play bet of 1x the Ante or fold their hand. In the case of a win, \nthe Ante, Blind (if applicable), and Play bets are paid out. In the case of \na loss, the Ante, Blind, and Play are forfeit. The player is given 1000 \nchips to start.\n"
